# FizzBuzzTDD
FizzBuzz Kata TDD. First time practicing TDD methodology. 

### Instructions
Write a function that takes positive integers and outputs their string representation.

Your function should comply with the following additional rules:

    If the number is a multiple of three, return the string "Fizz".
    If the number is a multiple of five, return the string "Buzz".
    If the number is a multiple of both three and five, return the string "FizzBuzz".

For example, given the numbers from 1 to 15 in order, the function would return:

  1<br>
  2<br>
  Fizz<br>
  4<br>
  Buzz<br>
  Fizz<br>
  7<br>
  8<br>
  Fizz<br>
  Buzz<br>
  11<br>
  Fizz<br>
  13<br>
  14<br>
  FizzBuzz<br>
